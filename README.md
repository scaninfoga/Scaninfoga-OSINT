# ! Notice For Deprecation !
This project is no longer being worked on by the developer. As of today, the program has many flaws and is not up to modern OSINT standards. A lot of APIs utilized within Scaninfoga-OSINT are no longer working as they did when the project was first released. The developer wrote Scaninfoga-OSINT out of boredom and as a side project therefore he is no longer working on it. The community is more than welcome to use Scaninfoga-OSINT's source as a base to improve on it's original capabilities to keep the tool alive. Please do not contact the developer to fix issues as he will not be replying as the project is deprecated. 

## About Scaninfoga-OSINT
Scaninfoga-OSINT is an OSINT tool developed in Python 3.6. Scaninfoga-OSINT lets users perform advanced searches on Instagram & Twitter accounts, websites/webservers, phone numbers, and names. Scaninfoga-OSINT also allows users to find all social media profiles (main platforms) assigned to a certain username. In continuation, Scaninfoga-OSINT has shodan support so you can search for devices all over the internet, it also has in-depth geolocation capabilities. Lastly, Scaninfoga-OSINT has a finance section which allows users to check if a credit/debit card number has been leaked/pasted in a breach and returns information on the cards IIN/BIN. This is the first version of the tool so please contact the developer if you want to help contribute and add more to Scaninfoga-OSINT.

## Installation
1: ```git clone https://www.github.com/scaninfoga/Scaninfoga-OSINT```<br/>
2: ```cd Scaninfoga-OSINT```<br/>
3: ```sudo python3 -m pip install -r requirments.txt```<br/>
4: ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --help```<br/>

## Usage
1. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --instagram davesmith --twitter davesmith```<br/>
Command 1 will return account information of that specified Instagram & Twitter account.<br/>
2. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --username rohan```<br/>
Command 2 will return all the social media (main platforms) profiles associated with that username.<br/>
3. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --username rohan -l="john doe"```<br/>
Command 3 will repeat command 2 but instead it will also perform an in-depth google search for the "-l" argument. NOTE: When searching a query with spaces make sure you add the equal sign followed by the query in quotations. If your query does not have spaces, it will be as such: ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --username johndoe -l query```<br/>
4. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py --info google.com```<br/>
Command 4 will return crucial WHOIS information about the webserver/website.
5. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py -r +14167777777```<br/>
Command 5 will dump information on that phone number (Carrier, Location, etc.)<br/>
6. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py -s apache```<br/>
Command 6 will dump all the IP address of apache servers that shodan can grab based on your API key. The query can be anything that shodan can validate.<br/>
A Sample API key is given. I will recommend reading API NOTICE below, for more information.<br/>
7. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py -s webcamxp```<br/>
Command 7 will dump all the IP addresses and ports of open webcams on the internet that shodan can grab based on your API key. You can also just use the ``webcam`` query but ``webcamxp`` returns better results.<br/>
A Sample API key is given. I will recommend reading API NOTICE below, for more information.<br/>
8. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py -g 1.1.1.1```<br/>
Command 8 will geolocate the specified IP address. It will return the longitude & latitude, city, state/province, country, zip/postal code region and the district.<br/>
9. ```python3 Scaninfoga-OSINT.py -c 123456789123456```<br/>
Command 9 will retrieve information on the IIN of the credit/debit card number entered. It will also check if the card number has been leaked/pasted in a breach. Scaninfoga-OSINT will return the card brand, card scheme, card type, currency, country, and information on the bank of that IIN. NOTE: Enter the full card number if you will like to see if it was leaked. If you just want to check data on the first 6-8 digits (a.k.a the BIN/IIN number) just input the first 6,7 or 8 digits of the credit/debit card number. Lastly, all this information generated is public because this is an OSINT tool, and no revealing details can be generated. This prevents malicous use of this option.

                        information on the IIN

## API NOTICE
The API used for the reverse phone number lookup (free package) has maximum 250 requests. The one used in the program right now will most definetely run out of uses in the near future. If you want to keep generating API keys, go to https://www.numverify.com, and select the free plan after creating an account. Then simply go Scaninfoga-OSINT.py and replace the original API key with your new API key found in your account dashboard. Insert your new key into the keys[] array (at the top of the source). For the Shodan API key, it is just a sample key given to the program. The developer recommends creating a shodan account and adding your own API key to the shodan_api[] array at the top of the source (Scaninfoga-OSINT.py).
